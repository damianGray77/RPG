A top down 2d RPG engine in the same vein as Final Fantasy 1-6.

Written using GDI+ without DirectX / OpenGL / Vulkan / etc.

Will support:
* Animated tiles
* Full alpha-channel overlays
* Dynamic weather and day/night cycles
* Character animations
* Water / Fire
* Dynamic lighting (maybe)
* Particle effects
* Dialogue with multiple response options
* Scripted events
* NPCs (friendly and hostile)
* Combat system
* Inventory system
* Leveling system
* More as I think of it
